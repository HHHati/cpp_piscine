# CPP Piscine

## 📘 Project Overview

The **CPP Piscine** is an intensive series of projects from 42 School designed to introduce the fundamentals of **C++ programming**.

Through multiple small exercises, this project covers core concepts such as object-oriented programming, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, memory management, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

Each exercise is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept, gradually increasing in complexity.

## ⚙️ Compilation

Each exercise comes with its own Makefile.  
The following rules are available for every project:

- `make`  
  Compiles the project.

- `make clean`  
  Removes object files while keeping the executable.

- `make fclean`  
  Removes object files and the executable.

- `make re`  
  Removes all compiled files and recompiles the project from scratch.

## 🧠 Notes

- Each module is independent and can be compiled separately.
- The projects strictly follow the 42 C++ coding standards.
- Designed to progressively build solid foundations in modern C++.
- Emphasis on clean code, proper memory management, and good design practices.
